# Estimating the Population mean using the z statistic(sigma unknown)

### Fundamental Problem
- Population Sizes might be too big: infeasible to capture each element in order to calc the **mean**
- #### Examples
> Estimating the average age of employees in a global company of 6000 employees
>
> Estimating the shelf life of loaves of bread

### Solution
- Take a random sample from the population and estimate the mean accordingly
