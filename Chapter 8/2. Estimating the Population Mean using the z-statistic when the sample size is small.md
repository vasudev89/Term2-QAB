# 2. Estimating the Population Mean using the z-statistic when the sample size is small

### Fundamental Problem
- Not all samples have a large enough size(n>=30)
- Central Limit Theorem cannot be applied to all such problems
- The distribution of sample means is approximately normal even for small sizes *if the population is normally distributed*
- Thus, if it is known
	- The population is normally distributed
	- It's sigma is known
- Then, the population mean can still be estimated even when n < 30

> __Example__
>
> As an example, suppose a U.S. car rental firm wants to estimate the average number of miles traveled per day by each of its cars rented in California. A random sample of 20 cars rented in California reveals that the sample mean travel distance per day is 85.5 miles, with a population standard deviation of 19.3 miles. Compute a 99% confidence interval to estimate mu.

> Solution
>
> n = 20, xbar = 85.5, sigma = 19.3, CFL = 99%(z=2.575)

> The point estimate indicates that the average number of miles traveled per day by a rental car in California is 85.5. With 99% confidence, we estimate that the population mean is somewhere between 74.4 and 96.6 miles per day.
